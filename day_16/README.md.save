# Day 16 – Process Management and Monitoring

## What I Did

- Learned how to identify running processes using `ps`, `htop`, and `grep`.
- Understood the concept of **PIDs (Process IDs)** — unique numbers assigned to each process.
- Practiced monitoring and controlling active processes.
- Simulated a long-running process using `sleep` and tracked it.
- Took a snapshot of all my system processes using `top -b -n 1 > ~/day_16/system_snapshot.txt
`
